# Cars.com-to-Offers
This is a collection of Python scripts that turn listings from www.cars.com into cash offers via scraping and requests.

Essentially what happens here is you fill out parameters into the cars.py script, which will create a comma separated value sheet in which the details are listed down of all the cars. Then, the same file is run through resultmaker.py, which inputs the same cars onto a website to retrieve an offer for them.

Improvements that could be made:
1. User input for www.cars.com search parameters.
2. More sites to input values into.
3. Integration between the two, run cars.py and then it automatically gets offers.
4. Automatic profit calculator.
